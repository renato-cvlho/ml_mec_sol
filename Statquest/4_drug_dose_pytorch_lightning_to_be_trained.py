## Create a neural network class that we can train by creating a class that inherits from LightningModule
##
## NOTE: This new class, BasicLightningTrain, contains two new methods for training:
##
## training_step() - This method takes care of 4 things:
##      a) calculates the loss for an epoch 
##      b) resets the gradients 
##      c) backpropagation 
##      d) updates the parameters
## configure_optimizers() - defines the method we will use to optimize the model
class BasicLightningTrain(L.LightningModule):

    def __init__(self): # __init__() is the class constructor function, and we use it to initialize the weights and biases.

        ## NOTE: The code for __init__ () is the same as before except we now have a learning rate parameter (for 
        ##       gradient descent) and we modified final_bias in two ways:
        ##           1) we set the value of the tensor to 0, and
        ##           2) we set "requires_grad=True".
        
        super().__init__() # initialize an instance of the parent class, LightningModule.

        ## The first thing we do is set the seed for the random number generorator.
        ## This ensures that when someone creates a model from this class, that model
        ## will start off with the exact same random numbers as I started out with when
        ## I created this demo. At least, I hope that is what happens!!! :)

## NOTE: Because we have so little data, and let's be honest, it's an unrealistically small 
## amount of data, the learning rate algorithm, lr_find(), that we use in the next section has trouble. 
## So, the point here is to show how to use lr_find() when you have a reasonable amount of data, 
## which we fake here by making 100 copies of the inputs and labels.

## If we want to use Lightning for training, then we have to pass the Trainer the data wrapped in 
## something called a DataLoader. DataLoaders provide a handful of nice features including...
##   1) They can access the data in minibatches instead of all at once. In other words,
##      The DataLoader doesn't need us to load all of the data into memory first. Instead
##      it just loads what it needs in an efficient way. This is crucial for large datasets.
##   2) They can reshuffle the data every epoch to reduce model overfitting
##   3) We can easily just use a fraction of the data if we want do a quick train
dataset = TensorDataset(inputs, labels) 
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset)

## Now create a Trainer - we can use the trainer to...
##  1) Find the optimal learning rate
##  2) Train (optimize) the weights and biases in the model
## By default, the trainer will run on your system's CPU
trainer = L.Trainer(max_epochs=20) 
## However, if we wanted to automatically take advantage of any available GPUs,
## we would set accelerator="auto" to automatically use available GPUs
## and we would set devices="auto" to automatically select as many GPUs as we have.
#
# trainer = L.Trainer(max_epochs=34, accelerator="auto", devices="auto")

## Now let's find the optimal learning rate
tuner = L.pytorch.tuner.Tuner(trainer)
lr_find_results = tuner.lr_find(model,
                                train_dataloaders=dataloader, # the training data

                                max_lr=1.0,   # maximum learning rate
                                early_stop_threshold=None) # setting this to "None" tests all 100 candidate rates
# lr_find_results = trainer.tuner.lr_find(model,
#                                         train_dataloaders=dataloader, # the training data
#                                         min_lr=0.001, # minimum learning rate
#                                         max_lr=1.0,   # maximum learning rate
#                                         early_stop_threshold=None) # setting this to "None" tests all 100 candidate rates
new_lr = lr_find_results.suggestion() ## suggestion() returns the best guess for the optimal learning rate

## now print out the learning rate
print(f"lr_find() suggests {new_lr:.5f} for the learning rate.")

# now set the model's learning rate to the new value
model.learning_rate = new_lr

## Now that we have an improved learning rate, we can train the model (optimize final_bias)
trainer.fit(model, train_dataloaders=dataloader)

print(model.final_bias.data)

## run the different doses through the neural network
output_values = model(input_doses)

## set the style for seaborn so that the graph looks cool.
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

## create the graph (you might not see it at this point, but you will after we save it as a PDF).

             color='green', 
             linewidth=2.5)

## now label the y- and x-axes.
