## NOTE: Even though we use the PyTorch module, we import it with the name 'torch', which was the original name.
import torch # torch provides basic functions, from setting a random seed (for reproducability) to creating tensors.
import torch.nn as nn # torch.nn allows us to create a neural network.
import torch.nn.functional as F # nn.functional give us access to the activation and loss functions.
from torch.optim import SGD # optim contains many optimizers. Here, we're using SGD, stochastic gradient descent.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ## matplotlib allows us to draw graphs.
import seaborn as sns ## seaborn makes it easier to draw nice-looking graphs.

## create a neural network class by creating a class that inherits from nn.Module.
class BasicNN(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self): # __init__() is the class constructor function, and we use it to initialize the weights and biases.
        
        super().__init__() # initialize an instance of the parent class, nn.Model.
        
        ## Now create the weights and biases that we need for our neural network.
        ## Each weight or bias is an nn.Parameter, which gives us the option to optimize the parameter by setting
        ## requires_grad, which is short for "requires gradient", to True. Since we don't need to optimize any of these
        ## parameters now, we set requires_grad=False.
        ##
        ## NOTE: Because our neural network is already fit to the data, we will input specific values
        ## for each weight and bias. In contrast, if we had not already fit the neural network to the data,
        ## we might start with a random initalization of the weights and biases.
        self.w00 = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(1.7), requires_grad=False)

## create the neural network. 
model = BasicNN()

## print out the name and value for each parameter
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    print(name, param.data)
    
## now create the different doses we want to run through the neural network.
## torch.linspace() creates the sequence of numbers between, and including, 0 and 1.
input_doses = torch.linspace(start=0, end=1, steps=11)

# now print out the doses to make sure they are what we expect...
print(input_doses)

## now run the different doses through the neural network.
output_values = model(input_doses)

## Now draw a graph that shows the effectiveness for each dose.
##
## First, set the style for seaborn so that the graph looks cool.
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

## create the graph (you might not see it at this point, but you will after we save it as a PDF).
sns.lineplot(x=input_doses, 
             y=output_values, 
             color='green', 
             linewidth=2.5)

## now label the y- and x-axes.
plt.ylabel('Effectiveness')
plt.xlabel('Dose')

## optionally, save the graph as a PDF.
plt.savefig('BasicNN.pdf')
